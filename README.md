# PySceneDetect-CSV-to-Vegas-EDL
Convert PySceneDetect CSV files to Vegas EDL files.


This is a Python 3 script that reads a comma-separated values (CSV) file generated by PySceneDetect, and creates a Vegas Edit Decision List (EDL) (which is a txt text file) from it which you can use as a base for a Sony Vegas/Vegas Pro project (possibly other NLEs as well).

Useful for when editing already-cut material such as archive footage, fan editing, Anime Music Video (AMV) making, or removing commercial breaks from TV broadcast footage, amongst other things.

# Usage

positional arguments:
VIDEO_FILE: Video file that you used PySceneDetect on.
INFILE: CSV file to convert.
OUTFILE: Name of the Vegas EDL text file.

optional arguments:
-h, --help: show this help message and exit
